    "# SF6 Model Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is performing poorly when modelling SF6, especially for country totals in Germany, which are too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign very large uncertainties to point source (temporally spiky, but probably location fixed) emissions, essentially discounting them. Since the bulk of SF6 is emitted this way (except for certain factories), we underestimate emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We seem to have similar problems with PFC-218 and HFC-23(?).\n",
    "\n",
    "## General issues with RHIME\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our basis functions don't split by land and sea (and this only ever worked for \"weighted\" basis functions)\n",
    "2. We have no cross validation, so we can't objectively assess our model performance (or compare between models)\n",
    "3. Our uncertainties seem miscalibrated:\n",
    "   - \"min model error\" is too low for SF6, and the reasoning behind our choice is somewhat weak\n",
    "   - our pollution event error is very high, and our (hyper)prior doesn't seem to decrease it\n",
    "4. Our prior uncertainties are very large, but our country emissions have small uncertainties\n",
    "5. We don't rescale prior uncertainties to respect the choice of basis functions, and we may be under-estimating our uncertainties by not accounting for \"aggregation error\" (but for our model, I'm unsure of where to add this)\n",
    "6. We have no correlations in any of our priors\n",
    "   - ELRIS uses spatial correlation in their prior uncertainties\n",
    "   - InTEM (and ELRIS) have temporal (and spatial between sites) correlation in their likelihoods\n",
    "7. Our boundary conditions use the same scaling factors for all sites; also our BC have no temporal correlation, we could enforce this by replacing our \"dummy matrix\" with one that does some temporal smoothing\n",
    "8. We have small country total uncertainties. Could this be caused by mapping back to the transport model resolution to make the country traces without adding aggregation error?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particular issues with SF6\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we omit flask data, our country totals are more in line with InTEM and ELRIS from about 2021 onwards\n",
    "2. Observations at HFD (and RGL?) have substantial biases (but we can account for this with a bias term)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we've looked at so far\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding a bias is a big improvement\n",
    "- Omitting flask data improves agreement with InTEM and ELRIS, but that is worrying\n",
    "- Setting a constant value for min error tends to improve agreement (and increase uncertainty of the country totals)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use different settings for the priors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Less prior uncertainty? (Or calibrate this for a certain total uncertainty... e.g. 100% like InTEM and ELRIS)\n",
    "- More obs (model-data mismatch) uncertainty?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insert model error more directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying `H @ x` by random variable (matching the output dimension `nmeasure`) centered on 1. This would apply model error more directly by saying we are uncertain about the values `H @ x` of enhancement above baseline. A similar method could be used to account for error at baseline times (uncertainty would have to be *very* small here). The likelihood would just contain instrument errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One question here is whether multiplicative errors are appropriate here.\n",
    "- We could try to apply the uncertainty to the elements of `H` itself, but this is complicated somewhat by combining footprint and flux ahead of time. Also, if we don't introduce correlation between this new error aligned with `nmeasure` and the existing prior on `x`, then there isn't really anything gained.\n",
    "- The form for this new uncertainty isn't clear. It would make sense to consider influences from farther away from the measurement site, or further back in time, as less certain. But I'm not sure we have access to the right data to compute this. Most likely it will be (truncated) Gaussian with mean 1 and fairly small uncertainties\n",
    "- It might make sense for each site to have extra scaling factors for particular basis regions (so... basically partial pooling by site?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fix basis functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fix land/sea split\n",
    "2. filter first to avoid using footprints that aren't used in the inversion to determine the average footprint times flux\n",
    "3. adjust uncertainties appropriately\n",
    "   - If we're reporting at the transport model resolution, there is an aggregation error term we probably need to add (but where, I'm not sure... literature is all for Gaussian models)\n",
    "   - A sum of lognormal RVs isn't lognormal (although there is a decent approximation using a lognormal), so the adjustment might not be straightforward\n",
    "4. (more work) use local search/simulated annealing to optimise results from quadtree or weighted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is probably not too hard to setup with the helper functions from `likelihood_tests.py`.\n",
    "- If it turns out that WAIC is a reasonable proxy, we could use that instead of K-fold CV\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look at synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "How does our model handle obs generated by an intermittent point source?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look at a simpler model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we do reasonably well with a Gaussian likelihood? Or Student-t likelihood?\n",
    "- Use CV to tune the ratio between prior uncertainty and model-data mismatch uncertainty?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "- temporal correlation between consecutive obs\n",
    "- simpler option: increase averaging period\n",
    "- spatial correlation between stations\n",
    "- spatial correlation between basis regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't added any variability term, like InTEM (and ELRIS?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there problematic observations?\n",
    "- Should we select e.g. 0:00-4:00 local time for mountain sites?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan/Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are we assessing performance?\n",
    "1. prior/posterior fit to obs\n",
    "2. \"agreement\" (with other models, inventory) for country totals\n",
    "3. CV scores\n",
    "4. Degrees of freedom for signal? (Need to balance with other error contributions?)\n",
    "5. WAIC or LOO-PIT?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How will we assess convergence?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arviz summary stats\n",
    "- Divergences\n",
    "- Possibly running extra long runs to verify shorter runs are consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "### What data will we train on? validate/test on?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should probably run multiple years. 2015-2019 seem problematic for RHIME.\n",
    "- We don't have flask data for 2015-2019, so that simplifies things.\n"
